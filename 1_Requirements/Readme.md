In this game, your goal is to eat as many small dots as possible while navigating a maze. Pacman’s movement is managed using the key board’s navigation keys up, down, left, and right.

# Research
In 1980 the Japanese arcade game manufacturer Namco Limited introduced the world to Pac-Man. The lead designer was Iwatani Tohru, who intended to create a game that did not emphasize violence. By paying careful attention to themes, design, and colours, Iwatani hoped that Namco could market an arcade game that would appeal to females. The game concept was therefore inspired by food and eating, as opposed to the shooting of space aliens and other foes that prevailed in most arcade games of the time. Instead, players maneuvered through a simple maze with a joystick, devouring coloured dots until all were gone, thereby completing a level and moving on to the next maze. In Japanese slang, paku paku describes the snapping of a mouth open and shut, and thus the central character, resembling a small pizza with a slice cut out for the mouth, was given the name Pac-Man.
